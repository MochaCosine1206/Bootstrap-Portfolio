                        <p>Hi!  My name is Steven Parrott and I'll keep it short and sweet.  
                        I have a beautiful daughter and wife, and I currently live in Mesa, AZ.
                        I have been working at Avnet Inc. for the last 5 years as a BI developer, Business
                        and data analyst, and general smasher of Excel.  My drive towards automating everything
                        I touch has brought me here.  Now I'm stuck in a boring position with low visibility and
                        an itch to move out of the state. <br><br>
                        Life is a journey.  The motivation behind how we live it is determined by an uncountable
                        number of characteristics, realizations, circumstances, and our own personal make up.
                        Many of my descisions are made due to the limited time I have on earth.  So, in the beginning,
                        which is to say, after high school, I floundered around a lot, trying on new realities like a
                        new pair of pants.  At some point, like many others in this class, I was compelled to drag myself
                        out of my terrible situation and finish my degree. <br> <br> 
                        
                        I was halfway through my credits and decided that creative writing was the only way out of
                        this situation.  During that journey, I was mentored by a beloved professor to go out and
                        experience new things, to understand my community, and so I did.<br> <br>
                        At the same time, my younger brother was also experiencing his own reniassance and was doing
                        study abroad in Costa Rica.  He invited me to travel with him up through Guatemala and Mexico.
                        This was the beginning of a new love.  I went back to Mexico once more, and also visited Japan.
                        I soon, decided to join peace corps and left for Kyrgyzstan.  Anyway, where was I going with this?
                        Oh yeah, I ended up, eventually, a few years later in Shanghai, where I met my wonderful best friend
                        and wife, Meggie.<br><br>
                        And here I am.
