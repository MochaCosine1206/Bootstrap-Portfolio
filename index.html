                                <p>Hi! My name is Steven Parrott and I'll keep it short and sweet.
                                    I have a beautiful daughter and wife, and I currently live in Mesa, AZ.
                                    I have been working at Avnet Inc. for the last 5 years as a BI developer, Business
                                    and data analyst, and general smasher of Excel. My drive towards automating
                                    everything
                                    I touch has brought me here. Now I'm stuck in a boring position with low visibility
                                    and
                                    an itch to move out of the state. <br><br>
                                    Life is a journey. The motivation behind how we live it is determined by an
                                    uncountable
                                    number of characteristics, realizations, circumstances, and our own personal make
                                    up.
                                    Many of my descisions are made due to the limited time I have on earth. So, in the
                                    beginning,
                                    which is to say, after high school, I floundered around a lot, trying on new
                                    realities like a
                                    new pair of pants. At some point, like many others in this class, I was compelled
                                    to drag myself
                                    out of my terrible situation and finish my degree. <br> <br>

                                    I was halfway through my credits and decided that creative writing was the only way
                                    out of
                                    this situation. During that journey, I was mentored by a beloved professor to go
                                    out and
                                    experience new things, to understand my community, and so I did.<br> <br>
                                    At the same time, my younger brother was also experiencing his own reniassance and
                                    was doing
                                    study abroad in Costa Rica. He invited me to travel with him up through Guatemala
                                    and Mexico.
                                    This was the beginning of a new love. I went back to Mexico once more, and also
                                    visited Japan.
                                    I soon, decided to join peace corps and left for Kyrgyzstan. Anyway, where was I
                                    going with this?
                                    Oh yeah, I ended up, eventually, a few years later in Shanghai, where I met my
                                    wonderful best friend
                                    and wife, Meggie.<br><br>
                                    And here I am.
